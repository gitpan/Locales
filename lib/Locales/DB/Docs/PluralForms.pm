=head1 NAME

Locales::DB::Docs::PluralForms - plural form details reference for all
included locales

=head1 VERSION

Locales.pm v0.09 (based on CLDR v2.0)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

CLDR L<defines a set of broad plural categories and rules|http://unicode.org/repos/cldr-tmp/trunk/diff/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html> that determine which category any given number will fall under.

L<Locales> allows you to determine the plural categories applicable to a specific locale and also which category a given number will fall under in that locale.

This POD documents which categories and in what order you'd specify them in additional arguments to L<Locales/get_plural_form()> (i.e. the optional arguments after the number).

=head2 “Special Zero” Argument

In addition to the CLDR category value list you can also specify one additional argument of what to use for zero instead of the value for “other”.

This won't be used if 0 falls under a specific category besides “other”.
